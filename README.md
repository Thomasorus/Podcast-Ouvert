# Podcast Ouvert

This repo contains the sources for the website Podcast Ouvert. Podcast Ouvert (open podcast) is a manifesto written by Yann Rieder to warn people about the centralisation of the podcast environnement. These past years a lot of startups emerged from nowhere, trying to become the *netflix of podcast* by inserting themselves between podcasters and their audience and willing to establish a monopoly.

The website was built in an afternoon and updated regularly to update the list of signatories.
